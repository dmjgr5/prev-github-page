#### Terms
epoch, batch size

#### Initialization
  - RBM (2006) -> Xavier
  - DropOut (2014) 
  - Ensemble : Merge learning model

#### Optimizer
  - gradient decent, adam and other optimizers


#### Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
  - How to connect layers : Forward, Split & Merge, Recurrent Network(RNN)
  - convolution, relu(2012), pooling, repeated.
  - stride, convolution, sampling, padding, pooling

#### Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
  - Stacked RNN, Softmax
  - Dynamic RNN
  - Time Series RNN
